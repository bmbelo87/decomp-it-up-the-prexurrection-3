# PumpyReconstructed

A faithful C reconstruction of **PUMPY.EXE**, the arcade executable for **Pump It Up: Premiere 3** (1999).

This project reverse-engineers the original x86 binary and reproduces its gameplay, rendering, audio, and state machine as closely as possible — no emulation, no wrappers. Native Windows executable built with OpenGL and DirectSound.

## Building

Requirements:

- Windows (the original targets Win95, but builds on 10/11)
- Visual Studio 2022 (or compatible MSVC)
- CMake 3.10+

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```

Place the resulting `.exe` in the game's root directory alongside the `AUDIO/` and `BGA/` folders from the original game. Assets are **not** included — you must provide your own copy of PUMP IT UP Prex 3 data files.

## Technical Notes

### Coordinate System

- OpenGL projection: **Y-UP** (0 at bottom, 480 at top)
- External API: **Y-DOWN** (0 at top, 480 at bottom)
- `Texture_DrawUV` converts Y-DOWN to Y-UP internally

### SPR vs SP2

- **`.sp2`**: u2/v2 are **offsets** (width/height) from u1/v1. Negative = flip. Use `SPR_LoadSP2()`.
- **`.spr`**: u2/v2 are **absolute** pixel coordinates (left/top → right/bottom). Use `SPR_LoadSPR()`.

### Judge Animation (FUN_0040dd70)

The judge display has three phases matching the original:

1. **Pop-in** (timer 24→11): Uniform scale from 1.43× down to 0.99× (ease-out)
2. **Stable** (timer 10→9): Scale fixed at 1.0×
3. **Squeeze** (timer 8→0): X-axis only scale shrinks (1.52→1.35) with alpha fade, additive blend

Perfect/Great get a longer animation (40 frames vs 25 for others). An implicit 0.8× scale is applied to the judge sprite itself.

### Hold System

Hold notes (heads, bodies, tails) use a per-panel auto-capture system:

- `g_holdRows[p][panel]` tracks active hold row
- Auto-capture scans from `g_nextNoteRow` for HH/HB/HT when button is held and timing window is valid
- Hold bodies use `g_fontArrowETC` with per-panel tile offsets
- Per-panel clearing avoids `memset` collisions with taps on hold rows

### Scoring

- Every note gives 1000 base + 1000 bonus if `combo > 3`
- Grade formula: `(perfect×10 + great×7 + good×5 + bad×2) / (total×10)`
- Thresholds: S≥0.95, A≥0.85, B≥0.75, C≥0.60, D≥0.40, F<0.40
